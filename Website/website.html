<h3>What is the Canadian Student Token (XCAN)? </h3>
  <p>The Canadian Student Token (known by its ticker XCAN) is a Stablecoin that is pegged Canadian dollar on a 1:1 basis. Every unit of this cryptocurrency in circulation is  backed up by 1 Canadian Dollar that is held in reserve, in a mix of cash and short-term Canadian Treasury bonds.
  </p>
  <p>The Stablecoin is designed for a world where cashless transactions are becoming more   common. Main use cases for the token would be where finance and education come into       play. It also allows students and schools to accept payments in digital assets, and       shake up the sector of education.</p>
  <p>By adding on to the financial and educational system, The Canadian Student Token       ensures a safe form of payment and rewarding system.</p>
  <p>Overall, the goal is to provide an effective digital payment while encourage           students to be more disciplined in school.</p>

<h3>Steps For Tokenizing CAD into XCAN</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>First the user will send Canadian Dollars to the issuer's bank account.</li>
    <br>
    <li>The issuer will use smart contracts to create an equivalent amount of XCAN.</li>
    <br>
    <li>The new minted XCAN are then delivered to the user and the CAD will be held in        reserve.</li>
    <br>
    <li>To redeem the XCAN into CAD, the user can request the issuer for an specific          amount by sending the equivalent amount in XCAN. (Redeeming tokens into CAD will          include a 20% penalty fee if the amount is below $100. Purpose is for encouraging         students to spend their tokens at school).</li>

<h2>FAQ & how crypto currencies work</h2>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Crypto Currencies vs Fiat Currencies</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Similar to fiat money, a cryptocurrency is used for financial transactions. Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that are not backed by governments and are mainly decentralized. It is different from fiat currencies because rather than being printed they are created or rewarded using proof-of-work or proof-of-stake.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">What is a blockchain?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>A blockchain records and stores information such as transactions on a token or coin. This database is decentralized and what is stored can not be changed. The blockchain operates through the network through nodes or computers.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Proof-of-Work vs Proof-of-Stake </button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Proof-of-Work rewards users for verifying blocks done through a computer, these are called crypto miners. Proof-of-Stake rewards users for staking a coin through smart contracts by locking certain amounts up. This shows that they value a certain cryptocurrency thus creating a consensus mechanism.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">What is decentralized finance?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>DeFi or decentralized finance is financial technology that lets a user trade, buy, and sell cryptocurrencies and tokens without someone in the middle. Meaning that if there was a transaction to occur it would be peer to peer and not a bank or a broker having to charge fees to trade through them. This allows users to have more freedom financially and be substantially more secure. </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Can anybody create and use a Canadian Student Token wallet?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Anybody can create a Canadian Student Token (XCAN) wallet and buy the token, although it would be better for high school students to use it as that is the main purpose. It is still a Canadian stable coin and a crypto currency so there is always value to using it. </p>

    <h2>WALLET STATE</h2>
<p>Being in stage 1, we are currently in our wallet testing phase. Users are currently able to create test wallets, although there is currently no use for it, as the Canadian Student Token (XCAN) is not available yet. Each wallet consists of 40 hexadecimal characters that will be unique to the user
ex. (0xAd2C9Ac9f99EdB3d9AB8DEDd01dFAA749CEF0). A Canadian Student Token address starts with 0x. Canadian Student addresses are generated by applying the Keccak-256 hash function to the public key, which is derived by applying ECDSA to the random generated wallet.
The wallet is expected to function once the final launch occurs. It was mentioned in the home page under 'HOW THE TOKEN WORKS:' section that students can get deducted tokens for skipping, this will not result in a negative balance if it were to happen when a 
student has a balance of zero. Something people might wonder is if teachers can deduct tokens that students bought. The answer to that question is that they can not, as a history will be recorded of which students they gave points. Schools will also not have multiple business wallets but only one that all 
staff will use.  </p>

    <h2>INTRODUCING OUR WEBSITE (YOUTUBE VIDEO) </h2>
    <p>A youtube video will be coming out shortly, it will be introducing our website along with the ideas for the project of the Canadian Student Token (XCAN). The video will explain the sections that we created, covering everything we have added on. This video will help people understand what our ambition is, 
    and goals for this project. As well as explain why we wanted to start it as a group of four. This is a huge help for us and we hope people who see it enjoy the content and our project. </p>
